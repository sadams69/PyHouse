Python Program to control my house with insteon and X10 devices. 
Started with someone else's insteon controls. 
HouseDefinition file needs editing to match your insteon setup. 
Uses SmartHome PowerLinc 2413S serial modem. 
Need to make sure that the serial port is the same as on your machine. It does not scan.
